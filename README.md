### Tech stack:

- [x] HTML to create the structure
- [x] vanilla CSS to design the webpage
- [x] Grid and flex layouts to implement the design.
- [x] BEM naming convention in writing CSS


### Process

- Firstly, to start off the project, I navigated to a newly created directory and created an empty git repo inside using `git init` command. The **FrontEnd Mentor 3-column preview card component challenge** repository is cloned in the created repo.
- Next, all the unused files, inline CSS etc were removed. Font families were added to the project using *Google Fonts CDN*. All the colors provided in the *style-guide.md* were added to the `:root` of the CSS. 
- A CSS reset was implemented. Font size of the page was set to 15px so that `1rem == 15px`
- The main page sanning the full viewport with appropriate background color was implemented. 
- The `card` component was implemented using *mobile first* design. The contents were added keeping *responsive design* in mind.
- Added media query to look according to the `designs` using `375px` for `mobile` and `1440px` for `desktop` breakpoints. The static page was tested on various viewports/devices using the Firefox mobile layout viewer. 
- A screenshot of the final result was taken using **Firefox screenshot** and was added to the project.
